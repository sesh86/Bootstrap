Beautify the aboutus.html file with the following tasks

Task 1:
=======
In this task you will be adding appropriate formatting to the web page contents using container, row and column classes using the Bootstrap grid so that the web page is formatted to look like in the images

The "About Us" title should stretch the entire width of the row.
The "Our History" part should occupy only half the width of the row for small to extra large screens, leaving space on the right side for more content to be added later. The content should be stacked for extra small screens.
The "Corporate Leadership" section should stretch the entire width of the row.

Task 2:
=======

In this task you will use some responsive utilities provided by Bootstrap to hide some of the content only for extra small screens. You will make use of the d-none and d-sm-block CSS classes provided by Bootstrap. To understand how to use these classes, please read the bootstrap documentation here (in particular see how the combination of classes shown here enables you to hide the content for xs screen sizes) to learn how to apply the d-none and d-sm-block classes. This will get you into the habit of consulting the Bootstrap documentation whenever you need to learn more about the various components and classes of Bootstrap. You should apply the classes so that the <p> elements containing the detailed descriptions of the corporate leadership is hidden only for extra small screens. Thus, your page should look like the mobile screenshot image on extra small screens.
